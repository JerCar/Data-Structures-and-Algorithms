# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
A home for Data Structures and Algorithims

A home for mainly python based algorithms and data-structures. I'm using ctypes to make it a bit of a challenge rather than using all the built in functionality of lists to do the lifting.

Included so far:
Algorithms
* Sorting - Insertion, Bubble, Selection Sorting, Heap, Quick Sort

Data Structures:
* Binary Search Tree, Doubly Linked List, HashTable
